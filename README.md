Genesis allows users to buy and sell used clothes at a reduced rate, or choose to donate them to women's shelters through our company. For each donation, purchase, and sale, our built-in carbon emissions tracker calculates each user's impact and rewards them with discounts on future purchases.

Built using:
- React Native
- Python
- Django
- Figma
